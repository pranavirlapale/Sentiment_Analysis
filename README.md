I have used basic data preparation libraries like Pandas, Numpy,Plotly,SNS and Matplotlib. Used Regex,Spacy and Keras preprocessing tokenizer for text cleaning and preprocessing. Applied sequence processing models like Bidirectional GRU, GlobalMaxPooling for down sampling. Got accuracy of 87 Percent.
